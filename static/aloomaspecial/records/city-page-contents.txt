How to Choose Your Porta Potty<h2>
Selecting the right portable restroom rental can seem complicated, but it's a matter of answering a few key questions:<list>
What is the Nature of Your Event or Project? A construction site has different needs than a formal wedding. A rugged standard unit is perfect for a work crew, while a luxury trailer is essential for black-tie events.^^
How Many People Will Be Attending? The number of guests or workers is the most critical factor. A standard industry guideline suggests one portable toilet for every 75 people over a 4-hour event. This ratio changes for longer events or when alcohol is served.^^
What Level of Comfort is Required? Consider your guests' expectations. For casual outdoor parties, a deluxe sink unit offers a great balance of comfort and value. For upscale events, only a luxury portable restroom will do.^^
Do You Need to Accommodate Everyone? For any event open to the public, the answer is always yes. You will need to include ADA-compliant units to ensure accessibility for all your guests.^^
By thinking through these points, you can better determine the quantity and type of portable toilet rental that will best serve your needs.
