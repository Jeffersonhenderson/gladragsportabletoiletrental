How to Choose Your Porta Potty<h2>

Selecting the right portable restroom rental can seem complicated, but it's a matter of answering a few key questions:<list>

What is the Nature of Your Event or Project? A construction site has different needs than a formal wedding. A rugged standard unit is perfect for a work crew, while a luxury trailer is essential for black-tie events.^^

How Many People Will Be Attending? The number of guests or workers is the most critical factor. A standard industry guideline suggests one portable toilet for every 75 people over a 4-hour event. This ratio changes for longer events or when alcohol is served.^^

What Level of Comfort is Required? Consider your guests' expectations. For casual outdoor parties, a deluxe sink unit offers a great balance of comfort and value. For upscale events, only a luxury portable restroom will do.^^

Do You Need to Accommodate Everyone? For any event open to the public, the answer is always yes. You will need to include ADA-compliant units to ensure accessibility for all your guests.^^

By thinking through these points, you can better determine the quantity and type of portable toilet rental that will best serve your needs.

We had a major renovation project, and I ordered a long-term port o potty rental in Avon, MN from Gladrags Portable Toilet Rental. The unit they delivered was clean and in excellent condition. What really impressed me was the reliability of their service—the truck came every week at the same time, without fail. The porta potty rental cost was very competitive, and their dependability made my job easier.<h2> – Bill T.

Every year, our neighborhood hosts a huge block party. This year, we decided to get a one day porta potty rental to save everyone's houses from the constant in-and-out traffic. We got a deluxe sink unit, and it was a total game-changer. It was spotless upon arrival, and people were so grateful for the clean facility and the handwashing sink. It was the best decision we made for the party.<h2> – Megan R.

The venue for our rustic outdoor wedding had very limited restroom capacity. We rented one of Gladrags Portable Toilet Rental's luxury restroom trailers in Avon, MN, and it was phenomenal. Our guests couldn't stop talking about the 'fancy porta potties'! It was air-conditioned, beautifully decorated, and felt nothing like a portable unit. It added a touch of class and solved a huge logistical problem for us.<h2> – Jessica and Tom P.
